<p><h3>The thinking behind your design</h3><br>

When thinking about the design of my website I came up with the following factors that were needed:<br>
<ul>
<li>Simple</li>
<li>Accessible</li>
<li>Responsive</li>
<li>Engage User</li>
<li>User Enjoyment</ul>

I believe that my website follows these, and below I will discuss more about how I achieved this.
<br><br>
<h3>Your use of HTML5 and CSS3.</h3><br>

On the website the is a lot of CSS3 and HTML5. Below in bullet points I will list where CSS3 and HTML5 have been used
<br><br>
<h4>HTML5</h4><ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
<li>Headers are used across the website for titles. As well as the menu at the top which is also a header which includes the Loughborough logo in which the user can click to navigate back to the top of the page</li>
<li>Footers are used across the website, main use of them is for the arrows which help the user navigate through the site. Furthermore the social media part of the website at the bottom is also a footer, the user can click the links of navigate back to the top of the page, while also access the social media pages.</li>
<li>Navs are use for the header at the top which has the menu links, which will help the user scroll through the website quickly by being able to quickly find the section they want to visit</li>
<li>Sections are the main semantic element used throughout the site. Each ‘page’ is a different section and this HTML5 element made the designing of a parallax website easier.</li>
<li>The form used for the potential student requesting a prospectus is also another HTML5 element. It includes different inputs such as:text, select and email. Once the submit button is hit the form checks the data to make sure all the required fields have the right information. If it does have the right information then it will go to another page,  which is php script to send an email directly to myself with the information so I could potentially send a prospectus to them. The php page then redirects them back to the website within 5 seconds or the user can manually do it themselves by clicking the link provided.</li>
<ul> 
<br>
<h4>CSS3</h4><ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
<li>The fading between each section, if the section is active there is an opacity of 1 and the CSS3 eases in the content using the transition property. It gives a nice fading effect. This is used alot on the website.</li>
<li>On the first section there is image slideshow showcasing images of Loughborough University. The CSS3 used here are: keyframes image animation, webkit filters, animation delays.</li>
<li>A transition is used for the contact form in which eases in the contact from where it is hidden at the bottom of the website.</li>
<li>The rest of the website is mainly pure CSS with a lot of margins, positioning, spacing etc. However with more pages there would be more opportunities to use a lot more CSS3.</li>
<br>

<h3>How you have made your site responsive</h3><br>

The main way in which I made the website responsive was by making use of the max-width/height property in my stylesheet. This is so that if the website was resized, then the content would resize to fit that property. However because there are text, margins for transitions etc. on the website which can’t be responsive by just CSS meant that  I needed to ensure that they would work properly on other devices. To do this, in one of the JS files ‘para.js’ there is script to detect what browser and screen size the user has. From this the JS file will then implement another CSS file which would match that screen size and then adjust things like font size, margins for transitions. These CSS files are labelled with names such as ‘style-mobile’, ‘style-normal’, ‘style-narrow’ for example. 
In doing this this makes my site responsive and should work on any device that will be used to access it. This also makes it more responsive than just having different types of web pages for different devices as this automatically changes the one webpage into a user friendly and responsive website for all devices.
<br><br>
<h3>The rationale behind your design and coding choices.</h3><br>

As discussed earlier, I decided the following factors that were a must for my website.<br>
<ul>
<li>Simple</li>
<li>Accessible</li>
<li>Responsive</li>
<li>Engage User</li>
<li>User Enjoyment</ul><br>
The first three factors were a must for any design, however the last two are not always on a website, this is mainly because it is down to perception from the user. Because it was down to perception I thought to myself ‘What type of websites do I find most enjoyable?’. Very quickly I got my answer - a parallax website. From personal experience I enjoy the fact that a parallax website is simple, flexible and that it cuts down loading times, while also making very good use of HTML5 and CSS3 with use of transitions and media.
The web user of today wants to get entertained and involved. With parallax scrolling you can do a bunch of great things to invite visitors to engage with the site. The interactive nature of parallax scrolling is an obvious advantage, and so is the level of engagement that comes with it.Parallax websites are becoming ever more popular among web developers because of this. Because I believe that a parallax website of these reasons I decided for coding and designing a parallax website using CSS3 and HTML5.
<br><br>
Coding wise, I wanted to make the most of CSS3 and HTML5. The use of both of these languages is stated above, but the rationale behind them was to engage the user and make the experience more enjoyable. Furthermore Javascript, Jquery and PHP was also used to enhance the experience of the website, by making the website more fluid and responsive. Javascript and Jquery were used to help detect the users screen size and assign a CSS stylesheet to make the website responsive. While PHP was used for the form so the user could send a request for a prospectus, in which I would get an email about the details they input into the form. I believe the use of these languages work hand in hand with CSS3 and HTML5 for the website.
<br><br>
<h3>Discussion of other issues</h3><br>

The main way in which the website has been made accessible is by the responsiveness of it. However I still felt that it needed more accessibility, I uploaded the website to co-project and tested it using the WAVE (Web accessibility evaluation tool) on the internet to see if it would come up with any accessibility errors. At first it did, however these were minor ones such as putting labels on my form. Once I fixed the errors that occurred then I tested it again and it said it was accessible. I trusted this website as it matches the website against WCAG guidelines, which is what all websites should abide by accessibility wise.
<br><br>
Furthermore I also wanted to validate my HTML5 and CSS, I did this by using W3 validator which I have used before for the module Team Projects. It is a very good tool for making code accessible and help make more sense of it. Much like the accessibility tool, I tested the co-project URL for both the HTML5 & CSS tester then corrected any errors. Errors for CSS ranged from code not being used to positioning, and HTML5 errors ranged from language issues to section issues.
<br><br>
Using all these tools throughout the design of my website helped perfect my code and make the website more accessible, simple and responsive.<br><br>

<h3>Furthermore all of the CSS files are fully commented.</h3>
