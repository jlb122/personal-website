To install the website you need the following program:

- phpMyAdmin program

Using phpMyAdmin find the database that you want to store the tables in and click 'Import' on the header.
On the 'import' page load the 'database.sql' file given with the website and then click 'Go'
The database tables should then be imported.

Once the database is installed simply edit the 'config.php' file to match the credentials of the phpMyAdmin login, password and database name. Furthermore also change co-project.lboro.ac.uk to the server your're hosting the website on.

That's it, feel free to contact me if you have any issues.
